<h4>Can I upload large genomes?</h4>
<p>The current limit for uploaded files is 50MB. If you need to annotate input
    genomes larger than that, it makes sense to run a stand-alone version of
    Companion on a sufficiently powerful machine, as it hits the limit of this
    web server. You can find the standalone version of Companion
    on <a href="https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/annot-nf">GitHub</a>.
    Please follow the instructions there to set up your stand-alone instance.

<div class="row">
<h4>How many jobs can I run at once?</h4>
<p>You can submit as many jobs as you like. They will all be added to the
   global queue and executed sequentially one after another. This server is a
   shared resource, so please refrain from submitting many jobs that compute
   protein-DNA alignments.

<h4>What format do the transcript evidence files need to have?</h4>
<p>Transcript evidence, for example, must be given in GTF format, for example
    as produced by <a href="http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/tools/">Cufflinks</a>
    (e.g. <tt>cufflinks</tt>, <tt>cuffmerge</tt> or <tt>cuffcompare</tt>). Here is an example:</p>

<p>Please note that the coordinates in this file must match the coordinate system of the corresponding uploaded sequence file and the IDs in the first column must match the sequence headers in the uploaded sequence.</p>

<h4>What do I do if I can't find a related species in the reference list, or there is no reference yet?</h4>
<p>You need to pick one of the given references to provide models for the gene finders as well as a set of chromosomes for input contiguation. If you can't use any of the references, just disable the contiguation option (which will leave your initial sequence untouched) and pick the closest reference in the list.</p>
