    <h1>Your job has finished!</h1>
    <p>
      Dear Companion user, your job "<%= @job[:name] %>" has just finished successfully!<br />
    </p>
    <% if (!@job.genome_stat) or  @job.genome_stat[:nof_genes] == 0 then %>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, no genes could be annotated in the sequence you submitted.
      This could be a result of input sequences that are too short to perform
      reasonable gene finding. Another possible reason could be high divergence
      of your species from the selected reference (<%= @ref[:name] %>).
      It might probably help picking a different reference.
    </p>
    <% else %>
      <% if @job.genome_stat[:nof_genes] > 0 and @job.genome_stat[:nof_pseudogenes]/@job.genome_stat[:nof_genes].to_f > 0.1 %>
        <b>
          Warning: Number of pseudogenes exceeded 10%. Please determine suitability of reference for submitted sequence.
        </b>
      <% end %>
      <p>
        To inspect your <%= @job.genome_stat[:nof_genes] %> genes just follow <%= link_to "this link", job_url(id: @job[:job_id]) %>.
      </p>

    <p>Thanks for using Companion and have a nice day!</p>
